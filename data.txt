When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful.

I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10.

Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.

I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. You’re disgusting.

I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."
